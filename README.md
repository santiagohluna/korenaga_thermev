# Thermev_korenga

## Purpose

The present project aims to implement the model developed by Korenaga (2006,2010) to describe the thermal evolution of the Earth's interior.

The first objective is to reproduce the results the aforementioned author obtained and published in the works cited.

Then, the second objective is to include tidal dissipation in order to evaluate its impact on the thermal history of the Earth.
